# Projects_Talentlabs
This is a repository of the projects I did in my Data Analytics training program under Talentlab

The game involves two players, 'X' player and 'O' player.
The game will start by printing the Tic-Tac-Toe board with numbers 1-9 on every tiles.
Numbers on the board represent the unmarked tiles.

The game will ask the player to give input of the position to mark the 'X' or 'O'
Once given the right input, it will switch to another player.

The game will end if any of the player got the winning match combination or
if the board is full without any winning match.

Then the program will ask the players again whether to play another or stop the program.
